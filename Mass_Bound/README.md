# MadGraph Results

The scalar leptoquark pair–production cross-sections were generated in **MG5_aMC v3.6.3** with the UFO model `SLQrules`.  
For each scan, only a single Yukawa coupling was switched on, and the leptoquark mass parameter was varied between ~0.6–1.8 TeV.  
The resulting cross-sections were compared with the 95% CL ATLAS limits (139 fb⁻¹, 13 TeV).
He we have not decayed the particle in to desired state but turned on the Yukawa to see any effect inthe pair production. Since $\Pi_7$ is triplet in SU(3), it is QCD dominated at production cross section.

We averaged the lower bound mass for $\Pi_7$ is : 1.2 TeV

These plots demonstrate how different Yukawa structures shift the exclusion, with theory predictions crossing the ATLAS 95% CL curves at different mass ranges.
## Comparison
We observe that for the charge-5/3 leptoquark in the $y_{12}$ coupling (electron channel), the lower mass bound is noticeably weaker than for the charge-2/3 leptoquark in the $y_{22}$ coupling (muon/jet channel).
A plausible reason is the high sensitivity of the ATLAS electromagnetic calorimeter, which enhances the efficiency of electron identification. However, this channel is also affected by larger Standard Model backgrounds (such as $Z/γ^* \to ee$ and $W \to eν$ with jets), which leads to fluctuations between observed and expected limits. In contrast, the muon+jet final state tends to have cleaner backgrounds and more stable reconstruction, giving a stronger exclusion.
