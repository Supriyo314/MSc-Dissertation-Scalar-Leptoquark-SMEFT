# Overview

This section provides a structured summary of the MSc Dissertation project on the **Phenomenological Study of Scalar Leptoquark Π<sub>7</sub>** and its collider constraints.  
The goal is to capture the physics motivation, theoretical framework, and key results in a concise, navigable format.

## 1. The Standard Model (SM)
The Standard Model (SM) of particle physics is a gauge theory based on the symmetry group:  

**SU(3)<sub>C</sub> × SU(2)<sub>W</sub> × U(1)<sub>Y</sub>**  

It successfully describes strong, weak, and electromagnetic interactions.  
However, the SM fails to explain:
- Dark matter  
- Matter–antimatter asymmetry  
- Neutrino masses  
- Gravity

---

## 2. Beyond the Standard Model (BSM) & Motivation
To address these shortcomings, new physics is required.  
Theoretical motivations include:
- Grand Unified Theories (GUTs)
- Supersymmetry
- Extended Higgs sectors
- Leptoquarks

Leptoquarks are hypothetical bosons that couple directly to a quark and a lepton, potentially explaining **Lepton Flavour Universality (LFU) violations** observed in B-meson decays.

## 3. Collider Physics & The Need for SMEFT
At hadron colliders like the **LHC**, searches for BSM particles require:
- High-energy parton collisions  
- Accurate modelling of SM and BSM processes  

**SMEFT (Standard Model Effective Field Theory)** is used when new particles are too heavy to be directly produced, allowing their effects to be studied through higher-dimensional operators.

## 4. About the Scalar Leptoquark Π<sub>7</sub>
- Gauge quantum numbers: **(3, 2)<sub>7/6</sub>**  
- Appears in SU(5) GUT models  
- Couples to both left-handed and right-handed fermions  
- Can mediate flavour-changing processes at tree level

---

## 5. Yukawa Couplings & Mass Constraints  
Detailed Yukawa interaction analysis is in the **[Yukawa & Mass](../Yukawa_and_Mass/)** section.  
This includes:
- Operator–coefficient matching in SMEFT  
- Collider bounds from pair production

---

## 6. Pair Production Studies  
See **[Pair Production](../Pair_Production/)** for:
- MadGraph simulations  
- Cross-section calculations  
- ATLAS/CMS exclusion limits

---

## 7. Materials  
Relevant files, figures, and final project documents are available in **[Materials](../Materials/)**:
- Dissertation PDF  
- Oral presentation slides  
- Additional plots
