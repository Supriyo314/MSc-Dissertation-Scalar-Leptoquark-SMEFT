# Overview
## 1. The Standard Model (SM)
The Standard Model (SM) of particle physics is a gauge theory based on the symmetry group:  

**SU(3)<sub>C</sub> × SU(2)<sub>W</sub> × U(1)<sub>Y</sub>**  

It successfully describes strong, weak, and electromagnetic interactions.  
However, the SM fails to explain:
- Dark matter  
- Matter–antimatter asymmetry  
- Neutrino masses  
- Gravity
- and many more

## 2. Beyond the Standard Model (BSM) & Motivation
To address these shortcomings, new physics is required.  
Theoretical motivations include:
- Grand Unified Theories (GUTs)
- Supersymmetry
- Extended Higgs sectors
- Leptoquarks

Leptoquarks are hypothetical bosons that couple directly to a quark and a lepton, potentially explaining **Lepton Flavour Universality (LFU) violations** observed in B-meson decays.

## 3. Collider Physics & The Need for SMEFT
At hadron colliders like the **LHC**, searches for BSM particles require:
- High-energy parton collisions  
- Accurate modelling of SM and BSM processes
  
Although currently we are runnig at 13.5 TeV enerygy, we have not found any particle 
-> the particel is massive 
-> can decay faster. 
Another process of observing these particles are SMEFT.

**SMEFT (Standard Model Effective Field Theory)** is a framework that integrates out the heavy partile and observe its effect on the SM process precisely. The UV lagrangian for the particel can be comapred to the multiplication of Wilson Coefficients and Operator. Depending on the mass dimension of the operator, mass dimension of the wilson coefficinet changes. 
(e.g if Operator of Mass dimension: 6 -> Wilson Coeff. mass dimension -2. )

## 4. About the Scalar Leptoquark Π<sub>7</sub>
- Gauge quantum numbers: **(3, 2)<sub>7/6</sub>**  
- Appears in 45 Higgs Dimensional of extended higgs sector of SU(5) : GUT models  
- Couples to both left-handed and right-handed fermions  
- Can mediate flavour-changing processes at tree level

## 5. Yukawa Couplings & Mass Constraints  
Detailed Yukawa interaction analysis is in the **[Yukawa & Mass](../Yukawa_and_Mass/)** section.  
This includes:
- Operator–coefficient matching in SMEFT  
- Collider bounds from pair production
