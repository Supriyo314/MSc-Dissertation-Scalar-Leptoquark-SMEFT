# Wilson Coefficients â€” SMEFT Fits

In the SMEFT framework, heavy new particles such as scalar leptoquarks generate
higher-dimensional operators once integrated out.  
Each operator $\mathcal{O}_i$ comes with a **Wilson coefficient** $C_i$ which measures
the strength of the new interaction relative to the scale $\Lambda$:


$\mathcal{L}_{SMEFT}$ = $\mathcal{L}_{\text{SM}}
+ \sum_i \frac{C_i}{\Lambda^2}\,\mathcal{O}_i$ .

- $\mathcal{O}_i$: effective operator built from SM fields  
- $C_i$: Wilson coefficient (dimensionless, encodes new physics)  
- $\Lambda$: scale of new physics

*Î”Ï‡Â² profile for $C_{lu}^{1133}$.  
The intersections with the 1Ïƒ (orange) and 2Ïƒ (red) lines give the allowed range
of this coefficient compared to the Standard Model prediction.*

*Allowed region in the $(|y_{33}|, M_{\Pi_7})$ plane.  
The blue contour shows low-energy SMEFT constraints, while the orange dashed
line indicates the collider pair-production bound. The overlap defines the
viable parameter space for the scalar leptoquark.*
