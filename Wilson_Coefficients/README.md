# Wilson Coefficients â€” SMEFT Fits

In the SMEFT framework, heavy new particles such as scalar leptoquarks generate
higher-dimensional operators once integrated out.  
Each operator O_i comes with a **Wilson coefficient** C_i which measures
the strength of the new interaction relative to the scale Î›:

    $L_SMEFT = L_SM + Î£ (C_i / Î›Â²) * O_i$

- O_i: effective operator built from SM fields  
- C_i: Wilson coefficient (dimensionless, encodes new physics)  
- Î›: scale of new physics

*ChiÂ² profile for C_lu^1133.  
The intersections with the 1Ïƒ (orange) and 2Ïƒ (red) lines give the allowed range
of this coefficient compared to the Standard Model prediction.*

*Allowed region in the (|y_33|, M_Pi7) plane.  
The blue contour shows low-energy SMEFT constraints, while the orange dashed
line indicates the collider pair-production bound. The overlap defines the
viable parameter space for the scalar leptoquark.*
